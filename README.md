#Desired outcome

The result should be an executable application, that finds all anagrams for provided word from a provided dictionary as fast as possible. The application is responsible for calculating the execution time and returning it in microseconds (Î¼s). We will be testing your code against the dictionary found here: http://www.eki.ee/tarkvara/wordlist/lemmad.zip
